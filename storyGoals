The goal of this story is to figure out what a good test is for rounding the percision.
good tests would include rounding up and down as well as rounding with no decimal places.
For example:

	42.42456 -> 42.4
	44.45678 -> 44.5
	79.98765 -> 80

The goal of this bug is to realize that there are missing tests. There should be a test
for each column in the table.

(3)
Here we need to write the test first, also it should be noted that all the infomation needed
is already in the response, so there is no need to make an extra call to the back end.

(4)
Want to show that you should design your code to be testable, may want to have the div be 
named so that it is easier to write the test.

(5,6)
More practice at writing Angular tests.

(7)
Goal is that validation should be done on BOTH the front and back ends. The back end is an
API and other application may call it, so it must validate the data.

(8)
Goal of this is major changes to both Java and Angular in a single story. Users can work 
front to back or back to front as they desire.

(9)
The goal of this is to figure out how to test something random like a date. Should consider
using a DateProvider interface simular to the pattern of the GameResulutIdProvider.

The goal of this is understanding Java Streams. One solution is the Stream.concat function.
